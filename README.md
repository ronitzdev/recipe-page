## Overview

A website that shows a recipe for tortilla.
It is a simple and organized design.
Little CSS, but style implementation, custom CSS.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- You will see an optimal display of fonts and images, new colors implemented.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I focused on the structure part rather than responsive, and creating a structure that does not need CSS styles as much.
Optimizing small changes to get closer to the design, visually checking between the design and what is currently developed.
